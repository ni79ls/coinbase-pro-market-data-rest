    "# How to Connect to Coinbase REST API and Display Bitcoin Historic Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "by Nils Ackermann\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you want to get started as a crypto investor and you want to take matters into your own hands, it is important that you are able to connect to a currency exchange such as [pro.coinbase.com](https://pro.coinbase.com). This is the essential first step to start data analysis and automation and move into algorithmic trading. In this notebook you will learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to connect to the public coinbase.com pro REST API via Python\n",
    "- How to load data from coinbase into Pandas\n",
    "- How to visualize Bitcoin (or any other crypto currency) historic data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The example uses Coinbase Pro as an exchange but it should be easily transferable to the other major digital currency exchange [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com). The full pro.coinbase.com documentation can be found [here](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com)."

    "## Step 0 - Imports, Libraries and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example, we need the following python imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Requests:** For connecting to the REST endpoints from Coinbase Pro, we will use [this](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) great HTTP library. Very user friendly. Only a few lines of code to connect via REST. \n",
    "- **Pandas:** For data analysis and manipulation we use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).\n",
    "- **Json:** We are dealing with json format, therefore let's import it. The documentation is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)\n",
    "- **Datetime:** We are doing some smaller data calculations, therefore we need [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html).\n",
    "- **Matplotlib:** At the end of the notebook, we will visualize some data, therefore we need [this](https://matplotlib.org) library.\n",
    "- **MPL Finance:** Formerly part of matplot lib, the finance module has been deprecated and is now in its own library. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance). We use this library to do the financial plotting at the end of the notebook. There is also an older version called mpl-finance. In case you have worked with mpl-finance before, I have also included the code in the backup at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "- **Seaborn:** For a nicer visualization of the plots, we will use [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will reuse some of the code throughout the notebook, we will define one functions first:\n",
    "\n",
    "- connect(url,param): this function takes the URL and optionally the parameters to a REST endpoint as an input\n",
    ". It then returns the response. If an error occurs, an exception is thrown and the error is printed."
